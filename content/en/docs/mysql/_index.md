While Kubernetes community users demand high-availability MySQL on Kubernetes, RadonDB community decided to transplant RadonDB MySQL to Kubernetes platform and made it an open-source project in 2021. The project aims to provide an enterprise-level high-availability solution to MySQL on Kubernetes for both Kubernetes and MySQL developers.

RadonDB MySQL is an open-source, high-availability, and cloud-native cluster solution based on MySQL. It supports the architecture of a primary database and multiple secondary databases, with a full set of management functions for security, automatic backup, monitoring and alerting, and automatic storage expansion, and so on. It has been used on a large scale in the production environment by users such as banks, insurance companies, traditional large enterprises and so on. RadonDB MySQL uses Xenon, which provides open-source high-availability components for MySQL clusters.

RadonDB MySQL Kubernetes supports installation, deployment and management on Kubernetes, KubeSphere, Rancher and other platforms, and automatically performs tasks involved in running RadonDB MySQL clusters.
