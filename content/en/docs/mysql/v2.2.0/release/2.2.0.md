# **Release notes**

## New features
- Support MySQL 8.0.
- Support custom backups. You can back up the cluster data to S3 or local volumes.
- Support scheduled backup to automatically back up clusters in scheduled time.
- Support cluster recovery. You can create new clusters from backups.
- Support defining the `my.cnf` parameter by users for more flexibility.
- TLS encryption is supported by the cluster server. The client can connect with the server in encrypted mode.
- Support automatic parameter adaptation. The cluster can automatically set some key parameters according to the resource quota of the Pod.
- Support automatic verification of the `custom resource` parameter to detect invalid parameters. For example, in MySQL 8.0, the `lower_case_table_names` parameter cannot be modified online.
- Support the `custom resource` additional print column. For example, you can run `kubectl get Clustername` to obtain the leader Pod in the current cluster.
- Add the backup status record to support querying the historical backup information of the cluster.

> Note: You need to manually upgrade the CRD if a historical version has already been installed locally.

## Improvements
- Enhance high availability and failover reliability.
- Simplify the Operator log.
