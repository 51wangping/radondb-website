# What is RadonDB MySQL Kubernetesï¼Ÿ
RadonDB MySQL is an open-source, high-availability, and cloud-native cluster solution based on MySQL. It adopts the architecture of a primary database and multiple secondary databases, with a full set of management functions for security, automatic backup, monitoring and alerting, and automatic storage expansion, and so on. It has been used on a large scale in the production environment by users such as banks, insurance companies, traditional large enterprises and so on. RadonDB MySQL achieves high availability by using open-source high-availability components provided by Xenon for MySQL clusters.

RadonDB MySQL Kubernetes supports installation, deployment and management on Kubernetes, KubeSphere, Rancher and other platforms, and automatically performs tasks involved in running RadonDB MySQL clusters.
