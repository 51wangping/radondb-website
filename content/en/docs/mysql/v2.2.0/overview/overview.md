# What is RadonDB MySQL Kubernetesï¼Ÿ
RadonDB MySQL Kubernetes is an open-source, high-availability, and cloud-native cluster solution based on MySQL. Its architecture is composed of a primary database and multiple secondary databases, with a full set of management functions for security, automatic backup, monitoring and alerting, automatic storage expansion, and so on. It has been used extensively for production by users like banks, insurance companies, traditional large enterprises, and so on. RadonDB MySQL Kubernetes achieves high availability by adopting open-source high-availability components provided by Xenon for MySQL clusters.

RadonDB MySQL Kubernetes currently supports installation, deployment and management on Kubernetes, KubeSphere, and Rancher, and automatically performs tasks involved in running RadonDB MySQL clusters.
